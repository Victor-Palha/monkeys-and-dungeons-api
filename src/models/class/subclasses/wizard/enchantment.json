As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you.

The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.\f On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.\f Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.",

The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\f You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.",
